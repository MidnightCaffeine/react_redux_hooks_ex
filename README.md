## React Redux Hooks Example (Currency converter app)

* This is a second part of our application.
* In the first part [REPO] (https://github.com/MidnightCaffeine/react_router_hooks_ex) we created currency convertor using only react with hooks.
* This is created using react and redux hooks
* Uses react router for navigation.
* Contains Login SignUp and Homepage, relevant state are maintained through redux.
* Basic validation check has been applied in signup and login.
* UI elements used using material UI.
* Some inline styles are there. (to be moved to scss)
-------------------------------------
* From login page you need to signup. Once signup done you can login.
* After login it lands to HomePage. Which is a basic currency converter,
* Takes input currency, amount to be converted and output currency from user.
* Uses Currency Convertor [API] (https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest)
* Logut Button to route back to login page.
* Contains basic validation in all pages.
